# Running and outputs

## Purpose

Apply this module to every capability. It defines how to invoke the bundled runner, use existing local authentication, recover interrupted jobs, persist final media safely, and validate deliverables before handoff. It does not define art direction or select a generation capability.

## Invocation

From the skill repository root:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py --help
```

From the `skills/game-assets/` directory:

```bash
python3 meowart_api.py --help
```

Use the bundled runner as shipped. Do not fetch or execute a remote replacement runner, a dynamic instruction document, or a provider proxy.

## Authentication

For a new installation, follow the [CLI setup and authentication guide](../meowart_api.md). Create a Meowa account key from the official account page, then store it locally as `MEOWART_API_KEY` in the environment or a Git-ignored `.env`. The runner never accepts credentials on the command line.

If authentication is missing:

1. Direct the user to the setup guide and help them configure `MEOWART_API_KEY` locally.
2. Never ask them to paste a credential into chat.
3. Never substitute a developer key, provider key, or custom service URL.
4. Verify setup with `credits-balance` before starting a billable generation.

The runner connects only to the official HTTPS Meowa service.

## Output directories

Always choose a new, explicit output root:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py <command> \
  <capability-options> \
  --output-dir ./outputs/<task-name>
```

Successful runs create one slug-named task subdirectory beneath that root containing:

- `final_outputs.json`, a sanitized manifest of final local outputs;
- the final image, audio, or video files that passed media-type validation.

The runner does not save submission responses, job responses, provider responses, debug metadata, signed source URLs, inline media payloads, or intermediate artifacts.

## Safe download contract

- Accept only HTTPS media downloads.
- Require an `image/*`, `audio/*`, or `video/*` response Content-Type before writing bytes.
- Select files from the exact final-output allowlist for the active capability.
- Treat public-bucket and signed URLs as untrusted unless the field itself is an allowed final output.
- Never recursively download every URL in a response.
- Never return input templates or references, masks, internal generation grids, server workflow manifests, metadata, stage files, or debug artifacts. Legitimate declared outputs such as a spritesheet or tileset atlas remain final deliverables.

## Polling and recovery

Normal `*-run` commands submit, poll, download, and save the final result. Keep the printed job identifier if polling is interrupted. Low-level recovery commands exist for compatibility, but do not present them as the normal workflow and do not write raw job payloads to disk.

When a run times out after submission, report the job identifier and the timeout. Do not resubmit automatically because that may create a duplicate billable job.

## Validation checklist

Before handoff:

1. Open every final file.
2. Verify the requested dimensions, format, and transparency.
3. Play audio, GIF, WebP, or video outputs through at least one complete cycle.
4. Test texture and background seams by repetition.
5. Preview pixel art only at integer zoom with nearest-neighbor sampling.
6. Read the local sanitized `final_outputs.json` as a validation manifest and confirm that it lists only the intended deliverables.
7. Return the listed media files, not `final_outputs.json` itself, unless the user explicitly asks for the local validation manifest.
8. Return clickable file paths and a concise note about the selected capability and validated properties.
